## Natural Language Processing of Social Media as Screening for Suicide Risk  

**Problem**: Text Classification (Detecting someone's suicide risk from social media posts)  
This research want to detect quantifiable signals around suicide attempts, and estimate suicide risk automatically.  
- Input: social media posts  
- Output: whether or not the post was composed by someone who would go on to attempt suicide  
  
**Question**: Because of the limited amount of training data available for the task, how to prevent overfitting the model to the training data?  
Answer: In this research, leverage both supervised and unsupervised learning methods.  
  
**Question**: The majority of this dataset was female users, Can the model be sufficiently expressive to also capture information for males?
Answer: Because there are some differences between male and female in psychology, in the scope of this research the authors only care about the common language comes across the genders.  
  
**Method**: Using deep learning for analysis of language
